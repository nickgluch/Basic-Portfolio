        <p>

            I'm 20 years old and starting KU coding bootcamp. I have no
            experience in coding. I work at Blackdog Coffeehouse.
            I also want to get into data science in the future.
            I went Shawnee Mission Northwest Highschool and live in
            the Lenexa area. I have a german sherpard dog named Rex, who is 12 years
            old. Some of my interests are music, lifting, books, and
            cars. I own a 2016 Subaru WRX currently. My favorite book
            is The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. My favorite
            music genres are indie, rap, and r&b. My favorite artists
            are Brockhampton, Rex Orange County, and Peach pit, Blood Orange, and The Marias.
            Things I'd like to do is travel again to Europe and Asia, learn how to play
            some instruments like guitar and piano. I'd also like to learn about music
            production. I'd also like to get into art, something like painting and sculpture.
